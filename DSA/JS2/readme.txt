Overview
This folder contains code for evaluating infix expressions and converting them between infix and postfix notations.

File A (reference JS code)
The source file provided at - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x_hvtxES0c-lfgZ5xVgpWq-ozfvN9Fxr/view 
suggests the evaluation of infix expressions, as evidenced by the output comments in the code.

Example:
 - Input: 23+ (Postfix expression)
 - Result: 5 (Answer after evaluation)

File B (Assignment details)
The file available at - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t_Mr-TZmAXQCM9q-Ggd6IduWpuxVBmeF/view 
discusses the conversion of infix expressions to postfix expressions in the first 8 lines.

Example:
 - Input: 2+3 (Infix expression)
 - Output: 23+ (Postfix expression)

Implementation in main.js
In main.js, the following steps are implemented:

1. Convert infix expression to postfix notation.
2. Evaluate the postfix expression.
3. Obtain the infix expression derived during evaluation.
4. Convert the derived infix expression back to postfix notation.

This implements the evaluation and conversion of expressions between infix and postfix notations.
